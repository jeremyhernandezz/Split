Squats - Squats give you the most bang for your buck in terms of exercising the most muscle groups.\n\n2.) Lunges - Like squats, lunges work all the major muscles of the lower body. They also help you improve balance.\n\n3.) Push-ups - When done correctly, the push-up can strengthen the chest, triceps, shoulders, and even the core trunk muscles, all at the same time.
